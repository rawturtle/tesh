First website I have created in my own time - 15/07/16. 

Purpose of building this website:
1. Practice basic HMTL/CSS/JS to cement knowledge gained from a 1st year Otago Uni paper
2. Practice using git and github
3. Practice using pre-existing libraries and integrating my own code.
4. Help out my cousin!
